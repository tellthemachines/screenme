It is a not-entirely-human performative artwork that challenges our perceptions about life and the materiality of the human body. ",

These works began with monochromatic green laser works 2006/20012 which evolved into the RGB works (three separate red and green and blue lasers) developed in 2013/14. These works have toured successfully for years now. Single Origin will extend my practice employing new technologies for controlling lasers with sound and developing new performance methodologies that marry sound and light at the level of signal path. The new work will focus on a single white beam. The combination of diodes necessary to create white light will also give access to all colours. The work will be spectacular  portable and tourable.

   "Project Description": "Too Much Lip is a novel of an Aboriginal clan - the Salters  - and their lives battling authority and scamming to survive in Durrongo  rural NSW. Mullumbimby (UQP)  was a story about an entire town. Too Much Lip has a sharper focus  being all about the humour  guts  and ultimate triumph of Kerry (36)  her long-suffering mother Aunty Pretty Mary  her brother Superman  and their other siblings  both those violently present and those tellingly absent. Harley-riding ratbag Kerry lives outrageously in the economic nether zone between criminality and respectability; inclusion and racist exclusion  heartbreak and revolutionary celebration. Her mission in life - to retire at 50 - is complicated by a promise to her mother to give up armed robbery  and to return to save the threatened family home.",

Our accumulated past as well as our immediate present is contained within landscape and a walk is only a step away from a story. Getting lost in landscape  as I often do  is a way to be fully present in a condition of uncertainty  extending the boundaries of the self into unknown territory; a way of becoming someone else.

The exhibition takes Guy Debourd’s poetic adage «Sous les pavés  la plage!» (Beneath the paving stones  the beach!)  as an approach to penetrate the urban landscape  to interrupt the cultural and reconnect or expose the natural  temporal and sensorial environment in which we inevitably reside.

Following my recent success and recognition in significant design awards  this project will mark an important milestone in my career. The work will consist of a suite of furniture  which extends both ongoing themes and new directions in my practice. This includes functional and conceptual exploration of voids and space created between repeating lines and geometry. The new direction  which this project will be concerned with  is the concept of ‘vanishing space’. This exploration of space  prompts innovative use of materials  processes and construction techniques  which all give way to furniture that elicits surprise and intrigue. The exhibition will take place in early 2017 at CRITERIA gallery in Melbourne.",

The exhibition engages with ideas of self-promotion through a feminist lens and considers the nature of women’s practice as holding up a collective presence as opposed to the heroism of the lone artist.  The statistical position of women in art is a platform to think about self-promotion as an articulation or position responding to women in the hierarchy of art. The exhibition will platform women’s individual practice and ask artists to respond to ideas of self-aggrandisement  vulnerability  discomfort with self-advancement and ways of measuring of success.",

Often drawn to epic and historical tales recounting human will  sorrow and optimism I came across the story of Polish composer Frédéric Chopin’s ‘traveling’ heart. It is this tale of romanticism that lays the conceptual bones for the proposed project.    In Siberia there is a lake. It is the world’s deepest lake. Nobody has ever touched the bottom. It is a place that is frozen over for most months of the year. A seeming endlessness  a void. Like death  it is unknown. The great nothing.    I will journey from the resting place of Chopin’s heart in Warsaw  Poland  through Russia to Lake Baikal  Siberia  as an ode to the humanity of trying where I will make new photographic work to document this gesture.",

The curators have identified the themes of continuity and circulation as key concerns for contemporary Australian artists. Of the twenty-one artists and one group participating in the Biennial  many explore circulation as a complex economic metaphor  or utilise it as an alternative way to exhibit their artwork outside the art system. The artists bring the past and future into the frame of their artworks  a mechanism that bypasses the impulse to think and act in the  here and now .",
