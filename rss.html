The Brayshaw family has a Christmas tradition. This one has nothing to do with ham, carols, or anything particularly festive. No, the way Andy Brayshaw and older brothers Angus and Hamish spend Christmas Day is by going down to their local park in Sandringham, marking out 100 metres, and running the distance 100 times. They have 30 seconds to run each 100, with 30 seconds rest in between each run.
