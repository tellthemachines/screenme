# Youbi Lee

"Visual artist UB (Youbi Lee)  in partnership with Melbourne Artists for Asylum Seekers  would like to present Asylum Silk Roads; a 6 month community art project for 250 asylum seekers in Greater Melbourne. The project provides a number of free stencil workshops for 5 asylum seeker support organisations in order to create a large textile artwork which will be exhibited in Melbourne and Dandenong in mid 2017. This project encourages social creativity as well as helping the broader community to recognise asylum seekers as active participants in our society."
