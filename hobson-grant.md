# Hobson Grant

"I am exploring themes of survival  endurance & family through sport. The oldest Aboriginal football club in Australia is the Koonibba Roosters on SAâ€™s remote far west coast. Generations of young men have represented their community on the only level playing field available.  Despite every obstacle placed before them they have prevailed in the local competition with remarkable skill & strength  they have also spawned AFL legends & influenced how the modern game is played.  I wish to recognise their individuality & their continuing existence reflecting on their resistance & their respect for those old men whose images adorn the walls of the Far West Aboriginal Sporting Complex.  My large scale work  will form part of the 2016 Basil Sellers Art Prize exhibition at the Ian Potter Museum of Art."
